It includes all data handling activities â€“ automated and manual â€“ that occur after collection and prior to the dissemination of estimates.                                                                       |                                      N/A      |                 N/A                                                                           |
| Cleaning, imputation, etc.                            |                 Before further processing, verification was performed to identify and eliminate potential duplicate records and to drop non-response and out-of-scope records.                                                                         |                                     N/A           |                     N/A                                                                        |
