# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `#1`

Describe the purpose of your survey: 
```
The purpose of this survey is to determine why there is a high turnover rate amongst entry and lower level positions in the tech department. 
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
``` 
Target Population: Individuals in entry and lower level positions in tech positions. 
Sampling Frame: All entry and lower level positions within the company. 
Sampling Units: Individuals
Observational Units: Individuals
Sampling Strategy: Simple Random Sampling 
Reasoning: The reason I selected simple random sampling is because my goal is to collect information from those in entry and lower level positions in tech positions only. From this population I don't need to further subdivide them so this would be the best method in this situation. 
```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. Do you plan on leaving the company within the next six months? Yes or No
2. Do you feel that your contributions are recognized and valued by your supervisors and colleagues? Yes or No
3. Have you received adequate training and support to perform your job effectively? Yes or No
4. Have you experienced any instances of workplace stress or burnout? Yes or No
5. How would you rate the support you receive from your immediate supervisor? On a scale from 1-10.
